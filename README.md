🖥️ Computer Hardware Management System (C++)
👋 About This Project

Computer Hardware Management System is a console‑based C++ application built as a Programming Fundamentals semester project.
It demonstrates core programming skills such as modular design, structured code, file handling, and user interaction developed during foundational coursework.

This system helps users manage a database of computer hardware components — letting them add, view, search, update, and delete records — all using a modular approach in C++.
