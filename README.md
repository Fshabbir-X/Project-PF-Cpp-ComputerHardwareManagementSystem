# 🖥️ Computer Hardware Management System (C++)
👋 About This Project  
Computer Hardware Management System is a console‑based C++ application built as a Programming Fundamentals semester project.It demonstrates core programming skills such as modular design, structured code, file handling, and user interaction developed during foundational coursework.  

This system helps users manage a database of computer hardware components — letting them add, view, search, update, and delete records — all using a modular approach in C++.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
1.C++ – Core programming language (functions, OOP basics)  
2.File I/O – Persistent storage of hardware records  
3.Modular Programming – Separate functions for each feature  
4.Standard Template Library (STL) – Used where applicable
