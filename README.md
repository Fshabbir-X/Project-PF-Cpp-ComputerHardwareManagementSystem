# Project-PF-Cpp-ComputerHardwareManagementSystem
 •	There are 3 projects in this file the first 2 are the file handling and 2D-array’s but we have updated them with structures and the data of structures is stored in 2 separate files such as hardware.txt and workstation.txt.
•	The 3rd project is the last one in which we had link between the new entity (Department) and the first 2 project entities. We acquired an entity which is using attributes of the last two entities such ID from Workstation Record Entity and Hardware Name from Purchase Record Entity.
•	The concept of modular programming is implemented in the code:
1.	Main file. (.cpp which includes menus and function calls)
2.	Header file (.h which has all the functions written in detailed body)

The first entity is Purchase Record:
First Attributes:
•	Hardware Name
•	Brand
•	Purchase Date
•	Price

The second entity is Workstation Record:
Second Attributes:
1. ID
2. CPU cores
3. GPU VRAM
4. Power Supply

The third entity is Department Record:
Third Attributes:
•	ID (previous attribute)
•	Hardware Name (previous attribute)
•	Department Name
•	Manager Name

The first code consists of following functions:
1. Add Hardware
2. View Hardware
3. Search Hardware
4. Delete Hardware
5. Update Hardware
6. Exit

The Second code consists of following functions:
1. Add Workstation
2. View Workstation
3. Search Workstation
4. Delete Workstation
5. Update Workstation
